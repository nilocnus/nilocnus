Hi there 👋 for stumbling upon my humble abode. I'm currently a CS student, project contributor, and food enthusiast. I enjoy spending my time writing, reading old and new media alike, learning new and fun stuff, creating graphics, developing, gaming, traveling, cooking, you get the gist. There's no opportunity that can't be explored.
